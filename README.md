# Section 1: Understanding the Complexity of Aviation Parts Procurement

The aviation industry is not like any other commercial sector. A bolt used in an aircraft is not “just a bolt”—it is an engineered part designed to withstand extreme pressure, temperature fluctuations, vibration, and fatigue.  

Several challenges make procurement difficult:

### **1. Supply Chain Fragmentation**
Manufacturers, surplus sellers, military depots, and global distributors all hold different inventories. No single source can supply everything.

### **2. Certification Requirements**
Aviation components require strict certifications such as:
- FAA  
- EASA  
- DoD / MIL-SPEC  
- AS9120B  
- ISO 9001  

This limits the number of trusted suppliers.

### **3. Obsolescence**
Many aircraft flying today were built decades ago. Their parts are discontinued, making sourcing even harder.

### **4. Long Lead Times**
Depending on part availability:
- Some ship in 24 hours  
- Some require 180+ days  
- Obsolete ones may have no OEM source  

This is why diversified sourcing is essential.
